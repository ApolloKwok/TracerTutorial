# Tracer(Not released yet)
Generates extensional properties orienting to inner traceable elements, and replaces traditional 
dependency injection tools like dagger, kodein and koin.


## Sample optimization
My sample misses some important details but I have no good idea to add corresponding Atm functions 
in moderate size. Welcome to optimize it or donate a demo small but displaying all important tracer 
details!
