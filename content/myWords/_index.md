Code in this project is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity,
difficulty, structure, efficiency, concision, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅ

This tool would help manage memory well assuming Kotlin is without GC, because most nodes only need
to manage its own element memories. In the near future, programming languages would be unified and
the whole IT development structure would be rebuilt.

In addition to this, I have two other halfway done works and am waiting for some company to help make
IDE plugins. I have sent resumes to common top internet companies, but those limited resume sizes are
too small and they didn't give me opportunities to display.

At last, if you are familiar with IT, feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.
