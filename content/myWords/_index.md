This tutorial is clear and worth learning by most authoritative IT tutorials, which is mainly 
because of bosses' belittling rather than myself. Below is my advice. 
- Let better developers write tutorials. Most tutorial code I've ever seen are half redundant. 
- Embed short videos with speeding up, effect display, and concise hints instead of all voluminous 
  texts.  

Code in this project is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity,
difficulty, structure, efficiency, and beauty. Wish you could learn from itÔºÅNote that it is too 
special and complicated to be a ksp development sample. 

In addition to `Tracer`, I have two other halfway done works and am waiting for some company to 
help make IDE plugins. I have sent resumes to common top internet companies, but those limited 
resume sizes are too small and they didn't give me opportunities to display.

At last, if you are familiar with IT, feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.
