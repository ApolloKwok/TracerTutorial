This tutorial is very clear and worth being learned by most authoritative IT tutorials, which is 
mainly because of bosses' overlooking rather than myself. 
- Let better developers write tutorials. Since most tutorial code I have seen are half redundant, 
don't say they are too intelligent to write simple words.   
- Embed short videos with speeding up, effect display, and concise hints instead of all voluminous 
  words.  
- Inspire them by relating their salaries to feedbacks.

Code in this project is probably the globally best at present for its functionality, creativity,
difficulty, structure, efficiency, and beauty. Wish you could learn from it！Note that it is too 
special and complicated to be a ksp development sample. 

In addition to this, I have two other halfway done works and am waiting for some company to help make
IDE plugins. I have sent resumes to common top internet companies, but those limited resume sizes are
too small and they didn't give me opportunities to display.

At last, if you are familiar with IT, feel hard to learn Kotlin and love Java or Go more, your logic
ability mustn't be well enough for you to engage in IT. If so, do something you love and must excel
at. I have no offensive intention, just meaning everyone has his strengths and weaknesses, and every
job has its threshold.
